**Classification of Encrypted IoT Traffic Despite Padding and Shaping.** Aviv Engelberg, Avishai Wool. [arXiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11188)

We examined a wide range of smart devices from diffeernt classes (cameras, plugs, bulbs, etc.) coming from well known vendors (e.g. Amazon, Belkin, etc).
The devices' traffic traces are from the open sources of [Sivanathan et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8116438) and [Trimananda et al.](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/packet-level-signatures-for-smart-home-devices/). 
You may use different traffic traces from other sources, but please make sure to follow the usage instructions below.

## Usage Instructions
To execute the code use run
```
python detectorIoT.py [action][directoryName]
